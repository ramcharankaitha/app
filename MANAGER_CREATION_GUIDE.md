# Manager Creation Guide

## How to Create a Manager (From Admin Dashboard)

### Step 1: Navigate to Managers Section
1. Log in as **Admin** using your admin credentials
2. In the left sidebar, click on **"Managers"** (or navigate from Dashboard → Managers)

### Step 2: Create New Manager
1. Click the **"+ Add New User"** button (top right of the page)
2. Fill in the manager details:
   - **First Name**: Enter manager's first name
   - **Last Name**: Enter manager's last name
   - **Email**: Enter manager's email address
   - **Store Allocated**: Select the store this manager will manage
   - **Address**: Enter manager's address (optional)
   - **Username**: Create a unique username for the manager
   - **Password**: Create a secure password for the manager

3. Click **"Create Manager"** button
4. Confirm the submission when prompted
5. You'll see a success message: "Save changes are done"

### Step 3: Manager Credentials
After creation, the manager can log in using:
- **Role**: Select "Manager" from the dropdown
- **Username**: The username you created
- **Password**: The password you set

## How Managers Use Their Credentials

### Login Process:
1. Go to the login page
2. Select **"Manager"** from the role dropdown
3. Enter the **username** (not email)
4. Enter the **password**
5. Click **"Sign In"**

### What Managers Can Access:
- Manager Dashboard (different from admin dashboard)
- Store-specific information
- Tasks and notifications
- Stock management
- Check-in functionality

## Important Notes:

1. **Username vs Email**: 
   - Admin uses **email** to login
   - Manager uses **username** to login

2. **Password Security**: 
   - Passwords are hashed and stored securely
   - Passwords cannot be viewed after creation
   - To reset, you'll need to update the manager's password

3. **Role Assignment**: 
   - All users created from "Managers" section are automatically assigned the "Manager" role
   - They will be redirected to the Manager Dashboard upon login

4. **Store Allocation**: 
   - Managers are assigned to specific stores
   - This determines which store data they can access

## Viewing Created Managers:

1. Go to **Managers** section from the sidebar
2. You'll see a list of all created managers
3. Each manager card shows:
   - Name
   - Role
   - Store allocated
   - Email

## Troubleshooting:

- **Can't login as manager?**
  - Make sure you selected "Manager" role in the dropdown
  - Use username (not email) to login
  - Verify the credentials were saved correctly

- **Manager not appearing in list?**
  - Refresh the page
  - Check if the creation was successful (look for success message)
